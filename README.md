# SensuFlow Github Action

The Github action for SensuFlow, a git based approach to managing Sensu resources.

## Introduction

This Github action will allow you to manage Sensu resources for multiple Sensu namespaces as part Github facilitated CI/CD workflows.
 
In order to use this action, you'll first need to define a Sensu user and associated role based access control. A reference RBAC policy and user definition, matching the the actions default settings is provided below as a reference. 


## How It Works

This action provides an opinionated best practises to using the `sensuctl create` and `sensuctl prune` commands in order to efficiently manage Sensu monitoring resources in one more namespaces. The action automates several resource linting actions to help ensure self-consistent monitoring resources are defined prior to updating any Sensu resources.

This is achieved by processing a directory structure where each subdirectory is mapped to a Sensu namespace.
By default the required directory structure looks like:

```
.sensu/
  cluster/
    namespaces.yml
  namespaces/
    <namespace>/
      checks/
      hooks/
      filters/
      handlers/
      handelersets/
      mutators/
  
```

where `<namespace>` is a placeholder for each Sensu namespace under management.  The `cluster/` directory can be used to optionally manage Sensu Cluster wide resources such as namespaces, if the Sensu RBAC profile in use allows for cluster-wide resource management.
  
## Setup

### Configure Sensu RBAC Profile

Below are instructions to create a RBAC profile that can be used with this action with the default settings. This profile makes use of Sensu CluserRole and ClusterRoleBindings to grant the action user access to a subset of Sensu resources cluster-wide. You may want to use a more restrictive RBAC policy to meet your security requirements.

You will need to run these commands in an an environment where sensuctl is pre-configured to communicate with the Sensu backend you want SensuFlow to work with.

#### Create the sensu-flow ClusterRole

The Sensu ClusterRole defines the resource permissions the github resource will need.

```
$ sensuctl cluster-role create sensu-flow \
  --resource namespaces,roles,rolebindings,assets,handlers,checks,filters,mutators,secrets \
  --verb get,list,create,update,delete
```

#### Create the sensu-flow ClusterRoleBinding

The Sensu ClusterRoleBinding connects the ClusterRole to a group of users

```
$ sensuctl cluster-role-binding create sensu-flow \
  --cluster-role sensu-flow \
  --group sensu-flow
```

#### Create the sensu-flow User

A Sensu user and password is needed to authenticate with the Sensu API. Make sure the user is a member of the `sensu-flow` group.

Create the user interactively:

```
$ sensuctl user create --interactive
? Username: sensu-flow
? Password: *********
? Groups: sensu-flow
Created
```

or, create the user non-interactively:

```
$ sensuctl user create sensu-flow \
  --password REPLACEME \
  --groups sensu-flow

```

### Configure SensuFlow Github action

In order to make use of this Github action you will need to use it as part of a github action workflow YAML definition. GitHub action workflow definitions are placed in `.github/workflow/` in your repository and must exist in the default branch. Please see the Github action documentation for specifics.

The action requires 3 configuration options to be defined:

```
sensu_backend_url
sensu_user
sensu_password
```

All other configuration options are considered optional

You will also want to considering GitHub secrets for sensitive information used in the action configuration. At a minimum you will want to consider using Github secrets for the `sensu_user` and `sensu_password`.

### Verifying Configuration

Below is a working example that will run the SensuFlow Github action when pushing to main branch or when a main branch pull-request is created.

#### Github Action Workflow Example

Save as `.github.workflow/sensu-flow.yaml` and commit to main branch. After activating the workflow in the Github UX, this action should run for any commits into main.

```yaml
name: SensuFlow CI Example

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  # Defined the SensuFlow job 
  SensuFlow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    # Step 1: Checks-out your repository, so your job can access it
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Step 2: use the versioned sensu/sensuflow action 
    - name: Sensuflow with required settings
      uses: sensu/sensu-flow@v0.3
      with:
        # Required configuration
        # Please make use of GitHub secrets for sensitive information 
        sensu_backend_url: ${{ secrets.SENSU_BACKEND_URL }}
        sensu_user: ${{ secrets.SENSU_USER }}
        sensu_password: ${{ secrets.SENSU_PASSWORD }} 
        # Optional configuration, if not present defaults will be used
        namespaces_dir: .sensu/namespaces
        namespaces_file: .sensu/cluster/namespaces.yaml
        matching_label: "sensu.io/workflow"
        matching_condition: "== sensu-flow"

```

### Your first SensuFlow workflow

Now that the action is activated and configured to run on any push into the main branch, you can test it.

#### Create a test namespace

edit the file `.sensu/cluster/namespaces.yaml` in your git repository and define a Sensu namespace resource for a new testing namespace.

```yaml
---
type: Namespace
api_version: core/v2
spec:
  name: test-namespace
```

### Create corresponding namespace directory

```
mkdir -p .sensu/namespaces/test-namespace
``` 

The SensuFlow action will process this directory, using resource definitions found within as a source of truth for the state of the corresponding Sensu namespace.

### Create a check in the test-namespace

mkdir `.sensu/namespaces/test-namespace/checks`
edit the file `.sensu/namespaces/test-namespace/checks/hello_world.yaml`

```yaml
type: CheckConfig
api_version: core/v2
metadata:
  name: hello_world
  labels:
    sensu.io/workflow: sensu-flow
spec:
  command: echo "hello world"
  interval: 30
  publish: false
  subscriptions:
  - test
  timeout: 10
```

### Commit and push changes

Once these files are in place, you can commit and push the changes back to Github. The Github SensuFlow action show trigger, and run to completion.
You can then verify using sensuctl in your administrative environment that the test-namespace exists

```
sensuctl namespace list
```

and that the namespace contains the hello-world check

```
sensuctl --namespace test-namespace check list
```

### Delete the check from the git repository

Now delete the `hello_world.yaml` file and commit the change again.  The SensuFlow action will use `sensuctl prune` to remove the check and you should beable to verify that the check no longer exists in the test-namespace.

## Github Action Configuration Reference

### Namespace Resource Management

This action uses a special directory structure, mapping subdirectory names to Sensu namespaces to process. By default the directory processed is `.sensu/namespaces/`  but this can be overridden in the action configuration. If this directory exists, each sub directory will be processed as separate Sensu namespace. Example directory structure:

```
.sensu
└── namespaces
    └── test-namespace
        ├── checks
        │   ├── check-cpu.yaml
        │   ├── check-http.yaml
        │   ├── false.yaml
        │   └── true.yaml
        ├── filters
        │   └── fatigue-check.yaml
        ├── handlersets
        │   └── alert.yaml
        ├── handlers
        │   ├── aws-sns.yaml
        │   └── pushover.yaml
        └── mutators
            └── check-status.yaml
```

Using this example, this action would process the `test-namespace`, pruning the namespace resources according to `matching_label`, `matching_condition`,  and `managed_resources`settings

### Optionally Preparing namespaces

If the namespaces file  (default: `.sensu/cluster/namespaces.yaml`) exists then this action will be used to create sensu namespaces before attempting to process the namespaces directory. 

Note: Namespaces are a cluster level resource, so in order to use the namespaces creation capability the sensu user will need cluser level role based access to create namespaces.

## Adapting to other CI/CD

If you would like to adapt this for other CI/CD, take a look at the  sensuflow.sh script from this repositorory. The script should be self-documenting with regard to needed executable dependancies and information concerning environment variables used.

## Goals 

SensuFlow is under active development, so please don't hesitate to submit issues for any enhancements you'd like to see. 

The main improvements we're currently focused on at the time of this writing (H1'21) are as follows: 

- Improved pre-flight tests (test Sensu endpoint liveness, verify authentication credentials, etc)
- Improved linting (label enforcement, type validation, etc)
- Validate integrity of assets (optionally fetch all configured assets, verify SHA512 values)
- Reference testing (if a check/handler refers to assets and/or secrets, are the asset/secret resource definitions also present?)
